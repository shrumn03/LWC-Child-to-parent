Creating an assignment for component events in Lightning Web Components (LWC) is a great way to 
reinforce your understanding of how component events work. Here's an assignment that you can 
complete:
**Assignment: Create a Simple To-Do List**
**Objective:**
Create a simple To-Do List application using Lightning Web Components (LWC). The application 
should consist of two LWCs: one for adding tasks and one for displaying the list of tasks. Use a 
component event to pass data (tasks) from the task addition component to the task list component.
**Requirements:**
1. Create a new Lightning Web Component called `taskAddition`.
2. In the `taskAddition` component, provide an input field and a button to add tasks to the list.
3. When a user enters a task in the input field and clicks the "Add" button, the task should be added 
to a list of tasks in the `taskAddition` component.
4. Create a custom component event in the `taskAddition` component that sends the list of tasks to 
the parent component when a new task is added.
5. Create another Lightning Web Component called `taskList`.
6. In the `taskList` component, receive the list of tasks using the custom component event from the 
`taskAddition` component.
7. Display the list of tasks in an ordered or unordered list (`<ul>` or `<ol>`) in the `taskList` 
component.
8. Ensure that the `taskList` component updates in real-time whenever a new task is added using the 
`taskAddition` component.
**Additional Challenges (Optional):**
1. Add a feature to mark tasks as completed.
2. Allow users to delete tasks from the list.
3. Implement validation to prevent adding empty tasks.
4. Use a Lightning Design System (SLDS) for styling.
**Submission:**
Share the code of your solution on a platform like GitHub or provide a detailed explanation of how 
you implemented the components and events.
This assignment will give you practical experience in creating Lightning Web Components, using 
component events for communication, and managing data between components. It's a valuable 
exercise for anyone learning or working with LWC in the Salesforce environment.

Explaination
 This code is for an HTML template file of a Lightning Web Component (LWC) called AddTasks. The component is designed for adding tasks and consists of an input field for task entry and a button to add tasks. Let me explain the key parts of this code:

<template>: This is the root element of the LWC template.

<div class="custom-container" style="background-color: white;">: This <div> is used to create a custom container for the content. It has a white background color.

Input Field for Adding Tasks:

1)<div class="slds-form-element">: This <div> is a part of the Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) and is used to style the input field as a form element.

2)<label>: This <label> element is used to provide a label for the input field, and it has the class slds-form-element__label to style it according to SLDS.

3)<input>: This is the actual input field where users can enter the task name. It has the type set to "text," an id attribute, and a value attribute to bind it to the taskName property in the component's JavaScript file. The oninput event is used to call the handleTaskNameChange function when the user enters text into the input field.

Button for Adding Tasks:

4)<div class="slds-text-align_center">: This <div> is used to center-align the button within the container.

5)<button class="slds-button slds-button_brand" onclick={addTask}>Add Task</button>: This is a button styled according to SLDS. It has the class slds-button to style it as a button and slds-button_brand to give it a brand color. The onclick event is used to call the addTask function in the component's JavaScript when the button is clicked.

import { LightningElement, track } from 'lwc';

export default class AddTasks extends LightningElement {
    @track taskName = '';

    handleTaskNameChange(event) {
        this.taskName = event.target.value; 
    }

    addTask() {
        if (this.taskName) {
            // Dispatch a custom event to send the new task name to the parent component
            const addTaskEvent = new CustomEvent('addtask', { detail: this.taskName });
            this.dispatchEvent(addTaskEvent);

            // Clear the input field
            this.taskName = '';
        }
    }
}

Explaination
This code is the JavaScript file of a Lightning Web Component (LWC) called AddTasks. It complements the HTML template described in a previous response. Let me explain the key parts of this code:

Import Statements:

1)import { LightningElement, track } from 'lwc';: This code imports necessary modules from the Lightning Web Component library. It imports LightningElement and the track decorator.
Class Declaration:

2)export default class AddTasks extends LightningElement {: This line defines a new class AddTasks that extends LightningElement. It's the class that represents the LWC.
@track Property:

3)@track taskName = '';: The @track decorator is used to mark the taskName property for reactivity. This means that when taskName changes, the component will re-render to reflect the new value. taskName is initialized as an empty string.
handleTaskNameChange Method:

4)handleTaskNameChange(event) { ... }: This method is called when the user types into the input field. It updates the taskName property with the value entered in the input field. The event.target.value is the text entered by the user.
addTask Method:

5)addTask() { ... }: This method is called when the "Add Task" button is clicked.
It checks if this.taskName is not an empty string (i.e., if the user has entered a task name).
If a task name is entered, a custom event called 'addtask' is created. The detail property of the event is set to the current value of this.taskName, which represents the task name entered by the user.
The this.dispatchEvent(addTaskEvent) statement dispatches the custom event, sending the task name data to the parent component or any component listening to this event.
After dispatching the event, the this.taskName property is cleared, resetting the input field for a new task entry.

<template>
    <div class="custom-container">
        <c-addtasks  onaddtask={handleAddTask}></c-addtasks>
        <lightning-card title="Task List" class="slds-card_white">
            <ul class="slds-list_ordered">
                <template for:each={tasks} for:item="task">
                    <li key={task.name} class="slds-text-title_bold">{task.name}</li>
                </template>
            </ul>
        </lightning-card>
    </div>
</template>
 
This code is for the HTML template of a Lightning Web Component (LWC) named Listoftasks. This component is designed to display a list of tasks and also includes a child component (c-addtasks) for adding tasks. Let's break down the code:

1)<template>: This is the root element of the LWC template.

2)<div class="custom-container">: This <div> element is used to create a custom container for the content. It doesn't appear to be styled further in this code.

3)<c-addtasks onaddtask={handleAddTask}></c-addtasks>:

This line includes a child component c-addtasks within the template. This child component is responsible for adding tasks.
The onaddtask attribute is used to listen for a custom event named addtask emitted by the c-addtasks component. When the addtask event is fired, the handleAddTask function in the parent component (Listoftasks) is called.
4)<lightning-card title="Task List" class="slds-card_white">:

This is a Lightning Card component with a title "Task List." It is styled with the class slds-card_white to give it a white background.
Inside this card, there's an ordered list (<ul class="slds-list_ordered">) to display the list of tasks.
5)<template for:each={tasks} for:item="task">:

This is a template for iterating over an array of tasks using a for:each directive. The tasks array is defined in the JavaScript file of this component and contains the task data.
For each task in the tasks array, the template generates a list item (<li>) and assigns a unique key to each task using key={task.name}. The key is used for efficient rendering and identification of items in the list.
The task name is displayed in bold (class="slds-text-title_bold") within each list item.

Listoftasks JS 
import { LightningElement,track } from 'lwc';

export default class Listoftasks extends LightningElement {
    @track tasks = [];

    handleTaskAdded(event) {
        // Access the updated tasks data from the event detail
        this.tasks = event.detail;
    }

    // Define a handler function for adding tasks
    handleAddTask(event) {
        const taskName = event.detail;
        if (taskName) {
            // Create a new task object
            const task = { name: taskName };
            // Add the task to the array
            this.tasks.push(task);
        }
    }
}
 
Explaination
The provided JavaScript code is for the Lightning Web Component (LWC) named Listoftasks. This component is responsible for managing and displaying a list of tasks. Let's break down the code:

1)import { LightningElement, track } from 'lwc';: This line imports the necessary modules and decorators from the LWC framework. In this case, it imports LightningElement and the track decorator.

2)@track tasks = [];: The @track decorator is used to declare a property called tasks. This property is an array that will hold the list of tasks. By marking it as @track, you ensure that any changes to this property trigger a re-render of the component.

3)handleTaskAdded(event) { ... }: This is a method that handles a custom event named addtask emitted by the child component (c-addtasks). When a new task is added, this method is called.

4)It updates the tasks property with the task data received through the event's detail property. This way, the list of tasks is kept up to date with the newly added task.
handleAddTask(event) { ... }: This is a handler function for adding tasks, and it is also invoked in response to the addtask event emitted by the child component.

5)It extracts the task name from the event's detail property.
Checks if the task name is not empty.
If a valid task name is provided, it creates a new task object with the name and adds it to the tasks array.
